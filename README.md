## Getting Started

To get started with deploying your website to GitHub Pages, follow these steps:

1. **Fork this repository:** Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner of this repository to create a copy in your own GitHub account.

2. **Clone the repository:** Use the following command to clone your forked repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/github-pages-test.git
   ```

3. **Ensure `index.html` is in the root:** Make sure your `index.html` file is in the root of the repository folder. If it's nested within a "develop" or "starter" folder, GitHub Pages may not recognize it as the main page. It will generally choose the README.md or other markdown file extension from the root folder if an `index.html` file is not available.

4. **Edit the HTML content:** Modify the `index.html` file in the repository to include your website's content. You can customize the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as needed to match your project.

5. **Commit your changes:** After making your changes, commit them to your local repository:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update website content"
   ```

6. **Push to GitHub:** Push your changes to your GitHub repository:

   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages makes it easy to deploy your website. Here's how to do it:

1. **Go to the Settings:** In your GitHub repository, click on the "Settings" tab.

2. **Scroll down to GitHub Pages:** In the left sidebar, scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section.

3. **Select the source branch:** Under the "Source" section, choose the branch you want to use for GitHub Pages (usually `main` or `master`).

4. **Save the changes:** Click the "Save" button to save your changes. GitHub Pages will now build and deploy your website.

5. **Access your site:** After a few moments, you'll see a message indicating that your site is published. You can access it at `https://your-username.github.io/github-pages-test`.
